# **Self-driving Autonomous Vehicles Project**

## Information

Hello! This project is based on the Udacity "Self-Driving Car Engineer" Nanodegree Program. Self-driving car algorithms uses computer vision, machine learning and robotics engineering concepts. In this project repository, it will contain various algorithms specific to achieving autonomous movements capabilities that uses some of these concepts.

### 1. Lane-line detection algorithm: 

Project to develop software capabilities to detecting lane lines in images and videos. Lanes act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle. It is one of the most important things when developing a self-driving car software algorithm. Refer to directory: [**self-driving-project/lane-line-detection/**](/lane-line-detection/)

### 2. Calibration camera algorithm:

Project to develop software capabilities to calibrate cameras into undistorted images and frames, and perform perspective transformation to obtain warped images. Refer to directory: [**self-driving-project/calibration-camera/**](/calibration-camera/)

### 3. Thresholding tecniques:

Project to develop thresholding techniques to alter images, such that we are able to better identify key features such as lane lines, etc. Refer to directory: [**self-driving-project/thresholding/**](/thresholding/)

### 4. Advanced lane-finding algorithm:

Project to develop software capabilities to detect lane curvature in images and videos. Refer to directory: [**self-driving-project/advanced-lane-detection/**](/advanced-lane-detection/)

### 5. Neural Networks

Project to develop algorithms for functions used commonly in machine learning, and to train neural networks on MNIST dataset. Refer to directory: [**self-driving-project/neural-networks/**](/neural-networks/)

### 5. Convolutional Neural Networks

Project to develop algorithms for functions used commonly in deep learning, and to train deep neural networks. Refer to directory: [**self-driving-project/conv-neural-networks/**](/conv-neural-networks/)

### 6. Traffic sign classifier project

Project to develop deep learning model used to detect and identify traffic signs, using the German Traffic Sign Dataset. Identifying traffic signs is an important aspect of self-driving capability, and the ability to follow road rules and regulations. Refer to directory [**self-driving-project/traffic-sign-classifier/***](/traffic-sign-classifier/)

### 7. Keras

Project to develop deep learning models using Keras. Refer to directory [**self-driving-project/nn-keras/***](/nn-keras/)

### 8. Transfer Learning

Project to develop deep learning models using pre-trained networks such as VGG, Inception (GoogLeNet), ResNet, AlexNet. Refer to diretory [**self-driving-project/transfer-learning/***](/transfer-learning/)
