# **Self-driving Autonomous Vehicles Project**

## Information

Hello! This project is based on the Udacity "Self-Driving Car Engineer" Nanodegree Program. Self-driving car algorithms uses computer vision, machine learning and robotics engineering concepts. In this project repository, it will contain various algorithms specific to achieving autonomous movements capabilities that uses some of these concepts.

### 1. Lane-line detection algorithm: 

Project to develop software capabilities to detecting lane lines in images and videos. Lanes act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle. It is one of the most imprt things when developing a self-driving car software algorithm. Refer to directory: [**self-driving-project/lane-line-detection/**](./lane-line-detection/)

### 2. Calibration camera algorithm:

Project to develop software capabilities to calibrate cameras into undistorted images and frames, and perform perspective transformation to obtain warped images. Refer to directory: [**self-driving-project/calibration-camera/**](./calibration-camera/)

### 3. Thresholding tecniques:

Project to develop thresholding techniques to alter images, such that we are able to better identify key features such as lane lines, etc. Refer to directory: [**self-driving-project/thresholding/**](./thresholding/)

### 4. Advanced lane-finding algorithm:

Project to develop software capabilities to detect lane curvature in images and videos. Refer to directory: [**self-driving-project/advanced-lane-detection/**](./advanced-lane-detection/)
